Activity 1 - Test your Java Programming Skills

The following problems will test your string manipulation and mathematical corner case programming prowess.
    1. Counting duplicate characters: Write a program that counts duplicate characters from a given string.
    2. Finding the first non-repeated character: Write a program that returns the first non-repeated character from a given string.
    3. Checking whether a string contains only digits: Write a program that checks whether the given string contains only digits.
    4. Removing white space from a string: Write a program that removes all white spaces from the given string.
    5. Checking whether two strings are anagram: Write a program that checks whether two strings are anagrams. Consider that an anagram of a string is a permutation of this string by ignoring capitalization and white spaces
